          ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm Nipun Agarwal, a passionate and forward-thinking
          Computer Science enthusiast hailing from the vibrant city of
          Hyderabad, India. Anticipating the completion of my Bachelor's degree
          in Computer Science in June 2024, I've been on an exhilarating journey
          of transforming ideas into impactful solutions.
          <br></br>
          My heart lies in crafting innovative solutions that address real-world
          problems. Whether it's empowering MSMEs with a robust digital presence
          or helping startups connect with their target audience, I thrive on
          building solutions that make a difference.
          <br></br>
          Collaborating with like-minded individuals is where I find my stride.
          I have a genuine passion for organizing events that foster community
          engagement and innovation. My journey has been marked by a deliberate
          choice to prioritize hands-on experiences and real-world challenges
          over the confines of traditional academic pursuits.
