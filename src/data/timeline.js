      "I started by working on a few landing pages for a client, where I was introduced to MDX and Next.js. These tools made publishing and maintaining blogs significantly easier and more efficient. Next, I delved into SEO for a course on Frontend Hire. I thoroughly studied the Google SEO documentation, which enhanced my understanding of search engine optimization and its critical role in web development. The most exciting part of the internship was working on a React Native client project, where I developed an ecommerce app powered by Expo and Supabase. This hands-on experience was invaluable and taught me the intricacies of mobile app development. It was here that I discovered React Query, a library that instantly became one of my favorites due to its powerful data fetching capabilities. Following the app development, we transitioned to creating an admin dashboard using Next.js.",
